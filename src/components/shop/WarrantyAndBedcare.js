            Highgrove guarantee to repair or replace any part of a mattress or
            bed base deemed to be defective due to faulty materials or
            workmanship as long as the bed is within the 12 month guarantee
            period. The 10 year warranties only apply when a mattress is
            purchased at the same time with an approved base. Bed Sets (mattress
            and base combined) sold with an inclusive extended warranty will be
            subject to a usage charge (payable prior to delivery of any
            replacement item). Please examine your bed carefully on delivery and
            report any damage to the retailer where it was purchased within 48
            hours.

          <h4 className="text-primary">Guarantee & Warranty Periods</h4>
          <p className="lead small mb-3">
            All guarantee & warranty periods begin from the date of delivery. If
            you suspect that there may a fault with your bed, please consult the
            section “Caring for your Mattress”. If you still feel there may be a
            fault, then please contact the retailer where it was purchased in
            the first instance and, if necessary, they will arrange for a bed
            inspection.

          <h4 className="text-primary">1 Year Guarantee</h4>
          <p className="lead small mb-3">
            A one year guarantee against faulty materials or workmanship applies
            to all models in the range - unless they have been sold as clearance
            items or, in the case of mattress only sales, have been placed on a
            non – approved base that is deemed unsuitable. Any mattress deemed
            to be subject to faulty materials or workmanship during the first
            year will be repaired or replaced free of charge.
          </p>

            during the first year will be repaired or replaced free of charge.
            Should the mattress or base be deemed to have developed a
            manufacturing fault after the first year of ownership the faulty
            item will be replaced subject to the following usage charges: In

          <p className="lead small mb-3">
            All reasonable efforts will be made to match fabrics and colours
            where an item is repaired or replaced, however a match cannot be
            guaranteed. Where the repair or replacement of a bed is not possible
            we will offer you the opportunity to choose an alternative product.
            If you select a product which is more expensive than the nearest
            equivalent you will need to pay the difference. It is the
            responsibility of the retailer which originally sold the items to
            arrange at-home product Inspections in line with the retailers own
            terms and conditions of sale. The guarantee is non-transferable and
            only applies to the original purchaser. Proof of purchase may be
            required. The guarantee only applies within our usual delivery areas
            within the mainland UK and Northern Ireland. Your Statutory Rights
            are not affected. Highgrove Beds will always honour your statutory
            rights.
